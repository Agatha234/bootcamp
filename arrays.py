#1. Compose a program that creates a one-dimensional array a containing exactly 1000 integers, and then attempts to access a [1000]. What happens when you run the program?
    
   d. indexing error
#2. What is wrong with the following code fragment?

    a = []
    for i in range (10):
    a[i] = i * i
  
A is declared as an empty array initially, that is, no elements are assigned to the array, therefore attempting to use its elements in an a statement will raise a run-time error.

#3. What does the following code fragment write?
      a = stdarray.create1D(10, 0)
       for i in range(10):
      a[i] = 9 - i
      for i in range(10):
      a[i] = a[a[i]]
      for v in a:
      stdio.writeln(v)
      My code didnâ€™t work
#4. What is a [] after executing the following code fragment?
n = 10 a = [0, 1] for i in range (2, n): a += [a [i-1] + a [i-2]] print (a)
      [0, 1, 1]
      [0, 1, 1, 2]
      [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
      [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
      [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
      [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
      [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
      [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
